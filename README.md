# dot_search

## Description
- This is a personal (experimental) repo that contains search algorithms that I am experimenting with for .dot files
- This code reads a square .dot file and creates a search from start to goal
- The end path is plotted on an image

## Requirement
- need to have a square image
- need to have a square dot graph
- each dot node represent a certain square pixel patch on the image
- can be used for path planning purposes
